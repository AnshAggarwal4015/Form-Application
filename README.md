# FormApplication

FormApplication is a React-based web application designed to simplify the process of collecting and managing detailed user information through an interactive multi-step form.

## Overview

The FormApplication is divided into two main components:

1. **Form1: Personal Details**
   - Collects user's personal information such as name, age, gender, contact details, and address.
   - Validates input data for correctness.
   - Provides dynamic error messages for each field.

2. **Form2: Professional Details**
   - Gathers information about the user's technical skills, spoken languages, experiences, educations, and GitHub link.
   - Allows users to add and remove multiple experiences and educations dynamically.
   - Validates and displays errors for each field.

## Features

- **Dynamic Form Fields:** Users can easily add or remove experiences and educations on-the-fly, making the form adaptable to varying professional backgrounds.

- **Local Storage:** Form data is automatically stored in the browser's local storage, enabling users to continue filling out the form even if they close or refresh the page.

- **Preview Option:** Users can preview their entered information before submission, ensuring accuracy.
